   You can imagine that our 2D linked list is a matrix, which MUST have
   a shape of rectangular at all time.

   The 2D doubly linked list with 4 elements (2 by 2) is like this:

    head -----------+   NULL              NULL
                    |    ^                 ^
                    |    |                 |
                    v    |                 |
                  +---------+         +---------+
    NULL <--------|    1    |<------->|    2    |------> NULL
                  +---------+         +---------+
                       ^                   ^
                       |                   |
                       v                   v
                  +---------+         +---------+
    NULL <--------|    3    |<------->|    4    |------> NULL
                  +---------+         +---------+
                       |                 |    ^
                       |                 |    |
                       v                 v    +--------- tail
                      NULL              NULL

    An empty list looks like this:

    head ------> NULL
    NULL <------ tail

    (If not empty) The head pointer of a list should always point to the
    upper-left most element, and the tail pointer should always point to the
    lower-right most element.

    The dim_row and dim_col stores the dimension of the rows and columns (i.e.
    the number of rows and columns).
